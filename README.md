# Zypher, Real Time Chat App.

This app is nowhere near finished. I'm still working on this project and learning a ton while developing.

## Scripts you can run:
To start the frontend:

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd ./client
foo@bar:~$ npm install
foo@bar:~$ npm start
```
To start the backend:

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd ./server
foo@bar:~$ npm install
foo@bar:~$ npm start
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have a `redis`[^1] and `MongoDB`[^2] container installed and connected to start the backend.


[^1]: `redis-stack` is recommended for easier development
[^2]: Preferably with `MongoDB Atlas` for easier development

## Used technologies:

### Backend:

1. Express
2. Cors
3. Socket.io
4. jsonwebtokens
5. bcrypt
6. Mongoose/MongoDB
7. Redis

### Frontend:

1. React.js
2. socket.io-client
4. Tailwind.css

### TODOS:
